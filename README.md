## COGNITIVE CLASS.ai: SPARK FUNDAMENTALS II - Labs Exercises Solved in PYTHON

This GIT is the Python solution to [Spark Fundamentals II](https://courses.competencies.ibm.com/courses/course-v1:BDU+BD0212EN+v1/about) course hands on laboratory exercises. The original exercises were programmed only in Scala and in order to develop my Python skills and get be used with Spark I solved all the execrcises using Pyhton 2.7.

### Requirements:

  * Python 2.7 installed
  * Spark 2.3.3  installed

### Directory Structure:

  * data.zip : data files used in the labs
  * Labs: Python files with the labs solutions
  * PDF: PDF files with labs exercise in Scala

### Lab Exercise 1:

The CLI command shall be executed in the Labs directory.

CLI to launch the exercise in the local machine: spark-submit --master local[2] lab1.py

If you are using LINUX ans just want to see only the lab1.py output use the grep command: 

CLI to launch the exercise in the local machine: spark-submit --master local[2] lab1.py | grep LAB1

### Lab Exercise 2:

The CLI command shall be executed in the Labs directory.

CLI to launch the exercise in the local machine: spark-submit --master local[2] lab2.py

If you are using LINUX ans just want to see only the lab1.py output use the grep command: 

CLI to launch the exercise in the local machine: spark-submit --master local[2] lab2.py | grep LAB2

### Lab Exercise 3:

In this labs was necessary create two helper classes nested under the class Utils. One class was used to store Trip objects and the other class was used to store teh Station object. In both classes the constructor parse the input files to its respective class attribute.

The CLI command shall be executed in the Labs directory.

CLI to launch the exercise in the local machine: spark-submit --master local[2] lab3.py

If you are using LINUX ans just want to see only the lab1.py output use the grep command: 

CLI to launch the exercise in the local machine: spark-submit --master local[2] lab3.py | grep LAB3

### Lab Exercise 4:


### Lab Exercise 5:
